        <h2>Eating in the City</h2>
        <p>Chicago is known for being a top rated city to eat and drink in. The city has even won awards for our tasty food, such as being rated the food and drink capital of the world according to a global survey via "Time Out Index". Here are a few of
            my favorite places to eat in the city! </p>

            For Breakfast, I enjoy going to Batter and Berries to indulge in their world famous french toast! Batter & Berries resides in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of the city with an address of 2748 N Lincoln Ave, Chicago, IL 60614. The doors to Batter & Berries
            opened up back in 2012 by Dr. Tanya & Craig Richardson who had the passion to add an eclectic world class restaurant to brunch scene in the city.The popular breakfast spot has been serving up creative offerings, such as decadent French toast
            flights and deconstructed omelets, and so much more. While Batter & Berries is most known for their take on breakfast food items, the restaurant also serves Lunch and Dinner. With multiple locations in the city, coffee lovers have the option
            to visit the Bronzeville, Hyde Park, or Rosenwald location. This coffee house, established in 2005 by Trez V. Pugh III Chicagoans from all walks of life who stop in for a break, a good cup of coffee and great community-focused conversations.
            Known for its exceptional quality and flavor, Sip & Savor coffees are certified fair trade, and in some cases, certified organic and shade grown. Be sure to stop by and have a sip!

            To satisfy your sweet tooth craving, head on over to Shawn Michelle's Homemade Ice Cream in the Bronzeville neighborhood on any given afternoon. I'm sure that you'll find a flavor combination fit for every mood. My favorite flavor here is the cookies
            and cream ice cream. Here is the scoop on Shawn Michelle's, the sweet spot is located at 46 E 47th St, Chicago, IL 60653 and offers homemade ice cream including a vegan menu!
